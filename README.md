A repository is a location where we can keep and organize the files for our specific projects, such as code, images, documentation, etc. In GitHub, repositories are essential to project organization and version control. They offer many other benefits that make them more user-friendly, such as tracking changes in the project, collaborating with others, and preserving project history.

The other advantages of the GitHub repository are as follows -
* We can control the version according to our requirement
* It is easy to create Branches within a repository and can experiment on the code without affecting the main code base
* Issues and Pull requests are possible. Hence, it helps make the code more efficient
* We can make our repository public or private
* Atlast README files are added in the repository which provides information about the overall project setup
